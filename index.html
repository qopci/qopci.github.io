      <h2>Journey into Tech</h2>
      <p>
       I've always loved games, so I had a computer at a young age. As time went on, I took a risk and, as a Running Start student, enrolled in an Associate's program for Software Development. Back then, I didn't know exactly where I would end up or what area I'd enjoy most. Over time, I discovered that I'm most passionate about digital design rather than backend work. I believe creating user-friendly, thoughtful interfaces is essential to delivering great experiences. Sometimes, I find myself daydreaming about how a website could look before I've even started the wireframe. Technology offers endless opportunities for creativity, and I'm excited to keep exploring whatever comes my way.
